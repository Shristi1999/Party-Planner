# Party-Planner
I have developed Party Planner website using Wordpress

An event planner is responsible for planning, organizing, and coordinating all aspects of an event.
It's purpose is to coordinate and execute all aspects of a party or special event such as Birthday's, New Yearâ€™s Eve, Festivals, Weddings, Concerts, etc.. to take care of every detail from concept to execution, including venue selection, catering, decorations, entertainment, and logistics, to ensure a seamless and successful celebration.
